# 15112-Term-Project
 End of semester project for CMU's Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science. Became one of the top 10 projects of that semester (of over 200 projects).

"Fall 2020 Romanticized" (alternative name: "Alice's Suffering") is a game inspired from my Fall 2021 semester experience and models after role-playing and dating simulation games. Players control "Alice" and must try to balance their health and stress levels through strategically allocating their time between schoolwork and fun. Users will have access to a back-tracking quest system and predictive task calendar, while progress can be saved by logging in with the same username as before. 

The project is built off of the 15112 graphic the JSON library. All art by Nhu Tat.
